# echo.filipton.space
A replacement for webhook.site and echo.websocket.org.

## Why?
echo.websocket.org was closed some time ago so i thought that replacement would be a good idea.

## Features
 - url request catcher (like in webhook.site)
 - websocket echo (for secure and not secure context's)

## TODO
 - [ ] working loggining system (github oauth)
 - [ ] custom responses (only for logged in users)
 - [ ] custom urls (only for logged in users)
 - [ ] slightly better UI (LMAO)
